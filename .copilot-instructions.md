# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Motordash

## 🚀 Project Context

You are helping to build the frontend for Motordash, a community platform for motorcyclists. The application includes a forum and a product catalog. The backend is already running on `localhost:3000` and is fully functional.

## 🎨 Design & UI Philosophy

**Priority on UI/Design:** I am counting on you, Copilot, to come up with creative and visually appealing UI proposals. Be proactive in suggesting layouts, components, and animations that enhance the user experience. Use the Tailwind CSS utility classes and the design tokens in `tailwind.config.js` as a foundation. Think about:

- **Components:** Propose well-structured and reusable Vue components.
- **Visual Hierarchy:** Ensure clear visual structures with whitespace, typography, and color.
- **Responsiveness:** All UI suggestions must be _mobile-first_ and scale well to larger screens.
- **Feedback:** Implement clear loading states, error messages, and success notifications.

## 🧠 Logic & Code Philosophy

**Logic is Supportive:** When it comes to logic, your role is supportive. I will write the core logic myself, but you can help with:

- **Simplicity:** Keep the logic as simple and readable as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity or abstractions.
- **Reusability:** Suggest composables when logic can be shared between components.
- **API Interaction:** Help with correctly calling the `apiService` and processing the response.
- **State Management:** Assist in using the Pinia stores (`auth.js`, `forum.js`) to manage the state.

**What to avoid in logic:**

- **No over-engineering:** Do not implement complex design patterns if a simple function will suffice.
- **No unsolicited refactoring:** Do not rewrite existing logic without an explicit request.
- **Focus on the goal:** Only generate code that directly contributes to the requested functionality.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Framework**: Vue 3 (Composition API with `<script setup>`)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Pinia
- **Routing**: Vue Router
- **HTTP Client**: Axios (via `src/services/api.service.js`)
- **Authentication**: Firebase (via `src/services/auth.service.js`)
  Code Structure Overview
  Here is an overview of your project's current structure, including the most important files and API endpoints.

Purpose of the Application
Motordash is a full-stack web application for motorcycle enthusiasts. It combines a community forum for discussions with a product catalog for motorcycle gear and parts. The backend is built with Node.js/Express and uses Firebase for data storage and authentication, and the Shopify API for product data. The frontend is a modern Vue 3 application.

Backend Structure (/backend)
The backend follows a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with clear separations for routes, services, and configuration.

backend/
├── config/ # Configuration for Firebase and Shopify
├── graphql/ # GraphQL queries for the Shopify API
├── middleware/ # Express middleware for authentication and uploads
├── models/ # Data models for the forum features
├── routes/ # API routes (auth, forum, products)
├── services/ # Business logic for forum, images, and Shopify
├── scripts/ # Scripts for database initialization
└── server.js # Main server file of the application
Key API Endpoints
The backend exposes the following RESTful API endpoints:

Authentication (/api/auth):

POST /register: Registers a new user.
POST /login: Validates a Firebase ID token.
POST /logout: Invalidates a user's refresh token.
GET /me: Retrieves the profile of the logged-in user.
PUT /profile: Updates the user profile.
POST /avatar: Uploads a new profile picture.
POST /sync: Synchronizes Firebase Auth data with the backend database.
Forum (/api/forum):

GET /topics: Retrieves a list of forum topics, including pagination and filters.
POST /topics: Creates a new topic.
GET /topics/:id: Retrieves a specific topic.
POST /topics/:topicId/answers: Adds an answer to a topic.
POST /vote: Processes votes on topics or answers.
GET /users/profile/:uid: Retrieves a user profile.
Products (/api/products):

GET /with-images: Retrieves products, including images, from the Shopify API.
GET /:id/with-images: Retrieves a specific product with images.
GET /collection/:id: Retrieves products by collection (category).
Frontend Structure (/frontend)
The frontend is set up as a modern Vue 3 application with Vite. The structure is organized around features (forum, products, auth) and reusable modules.
