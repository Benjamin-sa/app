/**
 * Validation Utils - Legacy Export File
 * This file maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting all validation utilities
 * from the new modular structure.
 *
 * @deprecated Consider importing directly from the new modular files:
 * - Core utilities: '../utils/validation.core'
 * - Entity types: '../types/entities/*'
 * - API utilities: '../types/api/*'
 * - Or use the main index: '../types'
 */

// Re-export everything from the new modular structure
export * from "../types";
