# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Motordash

## üöÄ Project Overview & Your Role

You are an expert AI assistant specializing in the **Vue 3 (Composition API) & Node.js/Express** stack. Your role is to help build Motordash, a full-stack community platform for motorcyclists.

Your primary function is to be a **creative design partner** on the frontend, proposing and implementing modern, visually appealing UI/UX solutions. On the backend, your role is to be a **strict architect**, meticulously following the established three-tier architecture.

## üé® Frontend Philosophy: Design-First, Modern Aesthetics

Your main goal on the frontend is to create a premium, polished, and engaging user experience. Go beyond basic functionality and proactively suggest implementations that are both beautiful and intuitive.

### Core Design Principles

#### Modern & Fancy Aesthetics

- **Gradients**: Use subtle background gradients (e.g., `from-gray-50 to-gray-100` in light mode, `from-gray-900 to-gray-800` in dark mode). For primary actions and titles, use more vibrant gradients like `from-primary-600 to-purple-600`.

- **Glass Morphism**: Implement `backdrop-blur-lg` with semi-transparent backgrounds (e.g., `bg-white/80`, `dark:bg-gray-800/80`) on sticky elements like headers and modals to create a sense of depth.

- **Smooth Animations**: All interactive elements must have smooth transitions (`transition-all duration-300`). Use hover effects like `hover:scale-[1.02]` and `hover:-translate-y-1` to provide satisfying micro-interactions.

- **Generous Rounding**: Use `rounded-2xl` or `rounded-xl` for cards and major containers to maintain a modern, soft aesthetic.

- **Progressive Shadows**: Enhance depth with `shadow-sm` on static cards, transitioning to `hover:shadow-xl` on hover.

#### Enhanced Card Design Pattern

This is the blueprint for all content cards:

```html
<div
  class="group bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-2xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-xl border border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-700/50 overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 hover:scale-[1.02] hover:-translate-y-1"
>
  <div class="relative aspect-[4/3] overflow-hidden">
    <img
      class="w-full h-full object-cover group-hover:scale-110 transition-transform duration-500"
    />
    <div
      class="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-t from-black/60 to-transparent opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity duration-300"
    ></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### Mobile-First, Responsive Design

Always design for mobile first. Use responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) to adapt layouts for larger screens. Grids should collapse to a single column on mobile (e.g., `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4`).

#### Engaging Feedback

- **Loading States**: Use spinners with descriptive text and a backdrop to indicate activity (see `LoadingSection.vue`).
- **Stores**: Use Pinia stores for centralized state management. Always use `computed` properties to derive UI data from the store.
- **Notifications**: Use the `useNotification` composable to provide clear, non-blocking feedback for user actions.
- **Empty & Error States**: Create visually appealing and helpful empty/error states with large icons, clear copy, and a call-to-action (see `NotFoundSection.vue` and `ErrorSection.vue`).

### Frontend Logic & Patterns

- **Composition API**: Always use `<script setup>` for new components.
- **State Management**: Use Pinia stores (`src/stores`) for all global state. Do not manage shared state within components.
- **API Interaction**: All backend communication must go through the `apiService` (`src/services/api.service.js`). Use the `useApi` composable (`src/composables/useApi.js`) to handle loading, error, and response states for API calls.
- **Reusability**: Before creating new components or functions, check for existing solutions in `src/components/common/` and `src/composables/`.

## üèóÔ∏è Backend Philosophy: Strict Three-Tier Architecture

The backend follows a strict separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and scalability. The data flow is always **Controller ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Query**. Never deviate from this pattern.

### 1. Controllers (`/features/*/controller.js`)

**Role**: To handle incoming HTTP requests and format outgoing responses.

#### MUST:

- Parse `req.params`, `req.query`, and `req.body`
- Call one or more services to execute business logic
- Wrap all service calls in `try...catch` blocks
- Catch errors from services and send a standardized JSON error response using `this.handleError()`

#### MUST NOT:

- Never perform data validation (e.g., checking for empty strings, email format). This is the service's job.
- Never interact directly with the database (`FirebaseQueries.js`) or external APIs (`shopify.service.js`)

### 2. Services (`/features/*/service.js`)

**Role**: To contain all business logic and validation. This is the "brain" of each feature.

#### MUST:

- Be the single source of truth for validation. Use `ValidationUtils` (`src/utils/validation.utils.js`) for all input validation
- `throw` a descriptive error if validation fails (e.g., `throw new Error("VALIDATION_ERROR: ...")`)
- Contain all business logic (e.g., processing a vote, creating a bike record)
- Call methods from the `FirebaseQueries` or `shopify.service` layers to interact with data

#### MUST NOT:

- Never communicate directly with other services. For example, `voting.service.js` cannot import and call `user.service.js`. If a controller needs logic from multiple services, it must orchestrate the calls itself. This is a critical rule to prevent tangled dependencies.
- Never handle `req` or `res` objects

### 3. Queries & External APIs (`/queries`, `shopify.service.js`)

**Role**: The exclusive layer for data interaction.

- **FirebaseQueries.js**: Acts as a facade that delegates to domain-specific query classes (e.g., `UserQueries.js`, `BikeQueries.js`). This is the only place where firestore is directly accessed. All new database interactions for a domain should be added to the appropriate class in `/queries/domains/`.
- **shopify.service.js**: Contains all GraphQL queries and logic for interacting with the Shopify API.

## üì° API Structure & Usage

The API is resource-based. Always check `server.js` and the relevant `*.routes.js` file to understand the endpoint structure before adding new features.

### API Endpoints

- `/api/auth`: User authentication and profile management
- `/api/forum`: Forum topics, answers, and user profiles
- `/api/bikes`: User bike gallery
- `/api/products`: Shopify product catalog
- `/api/messages`: Private messaging

### API Response Format

- **Success**: `res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: { ... } })`
- **Error**: `res.status(statusCode).json({ success: false, error: "ERROR_MESSAGE", ... })`

This standardized format is handled by the `BaseController`. Adhere to it for all new controller methods.
